# DealLoo

DealLoo is a web platform that helps users find the lowest available price of a product across multiple online marketplaces. Instead of selling products directly, it aggregates, compares, tracks price history, and notifies users about price drops — enabling smarter buying decisions.

The system is built using a modern web stack and deployed on AWS to demonstrate real-world cloud computing concepts such as scalability, availability, monitoring, and security.
